Algorithm Workbench
1. Write a method that accepts a string as an argument abd checks it for proper capitalization and punctuation. The method should determine if the string begins with an uppercase letter and ends with a punctuation mark. The method sould return true if the string metts the criteria; otherwise if should return false.
2. Write a method that accepts a string as an argument and displays its contents backward. For instance, if the string argument is "gravity", the method should display "ytivarg".
3. Assume the double variable number contains the value 12345.6789. Write a statement that uses the String.FOrmat method to format the number as 12345.7
4. Assume the double variable number containes the value 12345.6789. Write a statement that uses the String.FOrmat method to format the number as 12,345.68.
5. Assume the int variable number contains the value 1234567. Write a statement that uses the String.Format method to format the number as 1,234,567.
