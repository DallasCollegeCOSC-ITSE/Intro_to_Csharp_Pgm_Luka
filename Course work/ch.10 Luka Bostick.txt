4.Look at the following description of the prblem domain:
	The bacank offers the following types of accounts to its customers: savings accounts, checking accounts, and, money market accounts. Customers are allowed to deposit money into an account (thereby increasing its balance), withdraw money from an account (thereby decreasing its blance), and earn instrest on the account. Each account has an interest rate. Assume that you are writing a program that will calculate the amount intrest earned for a bank account.
