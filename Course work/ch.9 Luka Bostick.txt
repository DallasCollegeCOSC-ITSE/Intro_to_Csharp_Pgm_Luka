Algorithm Workbench

1. Look at the following structure declaration:

	struct Engine
	{
		public inr cylinders;
		public int hoursepower
		public int torque;
	}
Write a method that accets two Engine structures as arguments, determines if the two structures are equal, and return the the Boolen value true if the structures are equal or false if the structures are not equal.

2. Declare an enumerated data type type named Direction with enumerators for North, South, East, and West.

3. Give an example of instantiating a DateTime object named dt, initialized with the data Augest 22, 1965.

4. data and date2 are DateTime objects containing two difference dates. Write code that displays the values of theses two objects in chronological order.

5. Given the following declaration, write code that uses a TimeSpan object to add five days to the data1 object and assigns the result to a second DateTime object named data2.

		DateTime date1 = new DateTime(1977,3,22);
		
6. Write a statement that defines a Dictionary named food. The Keys should be string s, and the values should be int s.

7. Suppose a program declares a Dictionary as follows:

Dictionary<int, string> customers = new Dictionary<int, string>();

Write statements that use the Dictionary class's Add method to insert the following elements:

	9001,	"Jen Williams"
	9002,	"Frank Smith"
	9003,	"Geri Rose"
	
8. Suppose a program has the following Dictionary definition:
	
	Dictionary<int, string> customers = new Dictionary<int, string>();
	
Write a for loop that iterates over the Dictionary. Each element's key should be added to ListBox named customerListBox.

9. Suppose a program has the following Dictionary definition:

	Dictionary<int, string> customers = new Dictionary<int, string>();

Write an if statement that determines whether the key 999 exisits in the Dictionary. If the key exists, display the message "Customer 999 found" in a message box. Otherwise, display the message "Customer 999 not found."
