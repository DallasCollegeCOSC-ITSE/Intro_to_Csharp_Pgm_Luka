	c.Next
	d.sqeience
	
15.When you run an application, the application's form is loaded into memory and an event known as the __C__ event takes place.
	a.Seartup
	b.Begin
	c.Load

True or False
	1. If the ListBox is empty, the Items.Count property equals -1. FALSE
	2. The while loop is known as a pretest loop, which means it tests its condition before preforming an iteration. TRUE
	3. To increment a variable means to increase its value and to decrement a variable means tromeans to decrease its value. TRUE
	4. When a variable is declared in the initialization expression of a for loop, the scope of the variable is limited to the loop. TRUE
	5. The while loop always preforms at least one iteration, even if its Boolean expression is false to begin with. FALSE
	6. The trem read file is used to describe a file that data is read from. TRUE
	7. To append data to an existing file, you open it with the File.AppendText method.TRUE
	8. As items are read from the file, the read position moves forward, toward the end of the file.TRUE
	9. The numbers that are generated by the Random class are truly random. FALSE
	10. The Load event takes place after the form is displayed on the screen. FALSE
	
Short Answer
	1. What is contained in the body of a loop?
		expression that are repeated.
	
	2. Write a programming statement that uses postfix mode to increment a variable named count.
		int num = ++10;
	
	3. How many iterations will occur if the test expression of a for loop is false to begin with
		Zero.
	
	4. What are filename extensions? What do they indicate about a file?
		Filename extensions indicate the location of the files on the drive.
	
	5. When an input file is opened, what is its read position initially set to?
		Zero.
	
	6. How can you read all of the items in a file without knowing how many items the file contains?
		Looping until you reach the end of the file.
	
	7  What is a variable that is used to accumulate a total called
		accumulator.
	
	8. By default, the Open dialog box displays the constents of the user's Documents directiry, How can you specify another directory to be initially displayed?
		Pass the filename extension as a argument when you instancate the object.
	
	9. Why is the system time the preferred seed value for a Random object?
		Time is an always Changing constant.
		
	10. What kind of code should be placed in the Load event?
		Code that is running before the Form is displayed.

Algorithm Woekbench
	1. Write a loop that displays your name 10 times.
		for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++ )
			Console.Write("Luka Bostick");
	
	2. Write a loop that displays all the odd numbers from 1 through 49
	for(int i = 1; i < 49; i++)
		if(i % 2 == 1);
			Console.Write(i);
	
	3. Write a loop that displays every fifth number from 0 through 100.
	
	for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
		if(i % 5 == 0)
		Consol.Write(i);
		
		
	4. Write a code sample that uses a loop to write the numbers from 1 through 10 to a file.
		outputFile = file.AppendText();
		
		
		for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		outputFile.WriteLine(i);
	
	5. Assume that a file named People.txt contains a list of names. Write a code sample that uses a while loop to read the file and display its contents in a ListBox control.
		string Name;
		while(!file.EndOfLine)
		{
			Name = file.ReadLine();
			ListBox.Show(name)
		}
