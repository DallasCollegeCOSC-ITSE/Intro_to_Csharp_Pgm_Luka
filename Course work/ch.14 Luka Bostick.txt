1.If a LINQ query's source of data is a List<int>, the query will return a collection of the____type
	a.List<int>
	b.array of int
	c.IEnumerable<int>
	d.IQueryResult<int>
	
2.In a LINQ query, the____clause iterates over a collection of elements
	a.from
	b.for
	c.select
	d.where
	
3.In a LINQ query, the_____ clause determines what will be included in the query results.
	a.from
	b.for
	c.select
	d.where

4.The____clause causes the result of a LINQ query to be stored.
	a.sort
	b.orderby
	c.order
	d.sortby
	
5.You can wiite a LINQ query using either query syntax or____.
	a.pseudocode
	b.SQL syntax
	c.procedural syntax
	d.method syntax
	
6.In LINQ to SQL, a(n)____object represents a database.
	a.table
	b.entity
	c.data context
	d.row
	
7.In LINQ to SQL, a(n)____object represents a table in a database.
	a.table
	b.entity
	c.data context
	d.row
	
8.In LINQ to SQL, a(n)____object represents a row in a database.
	a.entity
	b.data context
	c.row
	d.record
	
9.The____is a visual design tool that you use to create the classes needed for LINQ ro SQL to work with a particular database.
	a.Database Designer
	b.Object Relational Design
	c.LINQ Designer
	d.Table Designer
	
10.To update an exising row in a database table, you call the data context object's____method.
	a.Update
	b.Commit
	c.Reload
	d.SubmitChanges
	
True or False
1.The var keyword makes code more difficult to read, but improves performance by a factor of 2.
2.In a LINQ query, the from clause iterates over a collection of elements.
3.You can use more than one where clause in a LINQ query
4.The C# compiler translates all LINQ quries that are written in method syntax to query syntax.
5.The data context object has table objects as properties that repesent the tables in the database.
6.A table object is a collection of entity objects thast represent the rows in the table.
7.One limitation of LINQ to SQL is that query results cannot be displayed in a data-bound control.
8.One limitation of LINQ to SQL is that you cannot insert or selete rows in a database table. Tables are essentially read-only.

Short Answer
1.in the following code, assume values is an array of double s. What is the data type of the result variable?

	var results = from item in nums
				  where item < 0
				  select item;

2.What are the two syntaxes that you can use to write LINQ queries?
3.What extension method do you call if you want to order a query's results in descending order?
4.In LINQ to SQL, how are databases, tables, rows, and columns represented?
5.Describe the process of inserting a new row into a table with LINQ to SQL.

Algorithm Workbench
1.Assume nums is a List of integers. Write a LINQ query that gets all the values from the List that are less than 0. Assign the results to a variable named results.
2.Assume nums is a List of integers. Write a LINQ query that gets all the values from the List sorted in ascending order. Assign the result to a variable named results.
3.Assume nums is a List of integers. Write a LINQ query that gets all the values from the List sorted in decending order. Assign the results to a variable named results.
4.Rewite the follwing query using method syntax:

	var result = from item in values
				 where item > 0 && item < 1-
				 orderby item
				 select item;
				 
	For Question 5-8, assume that a database has a table named Stock, with the following columns:
	
	Column Name				Type
	Trading_Symbol			nchar(10)
	Company_Name			nchar(25)
	Num_Shares				int
	Purchase_Price			money
	Selling_Price			money
	
	Also assume that a data object has been created with the following statement:
	
	StockDataContext db = new StockDataContext();
5.Write a LINQ to SQL query that returns all the columns form every row in the table.
6.Wire a LINQ to SQL query that returns only the Trading_Symbol column from every row in the table.
7.Wire a LINQ to SQL query that returns the Company_Name column only from the rows where Purchase_Price is greater than $50.00.
8.Wrie a LINQ to SQL query that returns the Trading_Symbol column only from the rows where Selling_Price is greater than Purchase_Price and
Num_Shares is greater than 100.
