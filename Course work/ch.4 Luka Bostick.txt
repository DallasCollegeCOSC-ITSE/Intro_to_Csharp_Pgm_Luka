Algorithm WorkBench
1.Write an if statement that assigns 20 to the variable y and assigns 40 to the cvariable x if the variable x is greater than 100.
2.Write x if the variable x is greater than 100.
3.Write an if statement that assigns 0 to the variable b and assigns 1 to the variable c if the variable a is less than 1-
4.Write nested decision structures that perform the following: if amount1 is greater than 10 and amount 2 is less than 100, display the greater of amount 1 and amount2.
5.Write an if-else statement that displays "Speed is normal" if the value of the speed variable is at least 24 but not more than 56. IF the speed variable's value is outside this range, display "Speed is abnormal."
6.Write an an if-slse statement that determines whether the value of the points variable is less than 9 or greater than 51. IF this is true, display "Invalid points." Othjerwise, display "Valid points".
7.Assume pointsTextBox is the name of a TextBox control and points is the name of an int variable. Write an if-else statement that uses one of the TryParse methods to convert the pointsTextBox control's Text property to an int and stores the result in the points variable. If the conversion is not succerssful, display an error message in a message box.
8.Rewrite the following if-else-if statement as a switch statement.


9.Assume nameListBox is a ListBox control. Write code that reads the selected item from the ListBox. Be sure to prevent an exception form occurring in case no item has been selected.
