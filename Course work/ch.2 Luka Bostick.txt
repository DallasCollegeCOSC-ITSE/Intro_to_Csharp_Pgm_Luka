		The bounding box indicates the location of the item on the screen.
	
	2. What happens when you position the mouse cursor over an edge or corner of a bounding box with sizing handles?
			It allows you to resize the form.
	
	3. What determines an object's appearance and other characteristics?
			The properties of the object.
			
	4. What is shown by each column in the Properties window?
			an alphabetical list of settings 
	
	5. What steps must you perform to change a form's Size property in the Properties window?

	10. In code, what characters do you enclose a string literal in?
			Quotation marks
	
	11. When creating an event handler for a button, is it possible to skip a step by opening the code and writing all the event handler code yourself?
		Why or why not?
				It is not; the instance auto generates and compiles code, so changing it would break the GUI.
		
	12.Briefly describe the difference between design time and run time.
		design time is tiem spent coding the project, and run time it the time spent running the application

Programming problems

		1. LATIN TRANSLATOR
			Look at the following list of Latin words and their meanings:
			
					Latin			English
					
					sinster			left
					
					dexter			right
					
					medium			center
					
					
		Create an application that translates the Lantin words to English. 
		The form should have three buttons, one for each Latin word.
		When the user clicks a button, the application should 
		display the English translation in a Label control.
		
	2. ClICKABLE NUMBER IMAGES
	In the Chap02 folder, in the Student Sample Program files, you will find the image files shown in Figure 2-79. Create an application should preform the following actions:
		
		*When the user clicks the 1 image, the application should display the word One in a message box.
		
		* When the user clicks the 2 images, the application should display the word Two in a message box.
		
		* When the user clicks the 3 image, the application should display the word Three in a message box.
		
		* When the user clicks the 4 images, the application should display the word Four in a message box.
		
		* When the user clicks the 5 image, the application should display the word Five in a message box.
		
		
	3. Card Identifier
	In the Student Sample Programs that accompany this book, you will find a folder named Image\Cards\Poker Large.
	In that folder you will find JPEG image files for a complete deck of poker cards.
	Create an application with five Picture controls. Each PictureBox should display a different card from the set of images.
	When the user clicks any of the PictureBox controls, the Name of the card should be displayed in a Label control.
	Figure 2-80 shows an example of the application running. The Image on the left shows the application's form when it starts running.
	THe Image on the right shows the form after the user has clicked the two clubs card.
	
	
	4. JOKE AND PUNCH LINE
	A joke typically has two parts: a setup and a punch line. For example, this might be the setup for a joke:
	How many programmers does it take to change a lightbulb?
	
	and this is the punch line:
	None. That's a hardware problem.
	
	Think of your favorite joke and identify its setup and punchline. 
	Then, create an application that has a Label and two buttons on a form. One of the buttons should read "Setup," and the other Button should read "Punch line."
	
	When the Setup button is clicked, display the joke's setup in the Label control.
	When the Punch line button is clicked, display the joke's punch line in the Label control.
	
	
	5. HEADS OR TAILS
	In the Student Sample Programs that accompany this book, you will find a folder named Images \Coins that contains images showing the heads and tails side of a coin.
	
	Create an application with a Show HEAD button and a Show Tails button.

	When the user clicks the Show Heads button.
	
	When the user clicks the Show Heads button, an image 
	of the heads side of a coin should appear. 
	
	6. ORION CONSTELLATION
	Orion is one of the most famous constellations in the night sky. 
	
	In the Chap02 folder of the Student Sample Programs that accompany this book,
	you will find an image file named Orion.bmp,
