10.A__D__ specifies which parameter an argument should be passed into.
	a. named argument

11. When a(n)___C__ is provided for a parameter, it becomes possible to call the method without explicity passing an argument into the parameter.
	a. local argument
	b. empty argument
	c. default argument
	d. expressional argument
	
12. When an argument is __C___, only a copy of the argument's value is passed into the parameter variable.
	a. named constant
	b. passed by association
	c. passed by reference
	d. passed by value
	
13.When you want a method to be able to change the value of a variable that is passed to it as an argument, the variable must be ___C___.
	a. passed reference
	b. a local variable
	c. passed by reference
	d. a named constant
	
14. A ___B__ a special type of parameter variable that is useful for establishing two-way communication between methods.
	a. communication variable
	b. reference parameter
	c. method parameter
	d. golabal variable
	
15.A(n)__C___ can have an uninitialized value passed into it, but it must be sent to some value before the method it belongs to finishes executing.
	a. input parameter
	b. reference parameter
	c. output parameter
	d. default parameter
	
16.A method's ___B__ is the type of value that the method returns.
	a. data type
	b. return type
	c. value type
	d. method type
	
True or False
1. Dividing a large problem into several smaller problems that are easily solved is sometimes called divide and conquer. TRUE
2. In a Pascal case name, the first character is always uppercase.TRUE
3. If a method belongs to a class, the you must write a method's definition inside the class.TRUE
4. The contents of variables and the values of expressions cannot be passed as arguments. FALSE
5. You do not have to write the data type for each parameter variable that is declared in a parameter list if they are all of the same data type. TRUE
6. An output parameter works like a by value parameter.  TRUE
7. A value-returning method must contain a return statement. TRUE
8. A Boolean method returns either yes or no. TRUE

Short Answer
1. What do you call a method that executes the statements it contains and then returns a value back to the statement that called it?
	A value returning method.
	
2. What is the standard naming convention used among C# programmers for method names? Why?
	Pascal is used for the method names as a hold over standard from c/c++.
	
3. What is another name for the top-down design process?
	Functional programing is a programming paradime that mainly consistes of functions 

4. What is a parameter list?
	The inputs a method recieves in order to perform work with said methods 
	
5. How do you specify a named argument?
	You use a string literal to define a arguments name.

6. How are output parameters different from reference parameters?
	Output parameters must set the output parameter before it finishes executing.

7. How is a value-returning method like a void method? How is it different?
	Both value-returing and void methods contain method headers, the ablity to pass reference parameters, etc. The difference is that void methods do no return a value back, but they still perform work

8. Can Boolean methods be used to modularize input validation? Why or why not?
	Yes, A Boolean method used as the argument of an if statement would perform the body of the if statement only if the input is validated.

Algorithm Workbench

1. Examine the following method header; then write an example call to the method.
	private void ShowValue()
	
	if(argument)
	{
		ShowValue()
	}
	else
	{
		return 0;
	}

	
2. The following statement calls a method named ShowHalf. The ShowHalf method displays a value that is half that of the argument. Write the method.
	ShowHalf(50);
	
	
		private void ShowHalf(decimal num)
		{
			Console.WriteLine(num/num);
		}

3. Write the method header for a method named ShowRetailPrice. The method should include parameter variables for a list price and a markup percentage.
 Write the method so that the default arguments for the markup percentage is set to 50 percent.
 
		public void ShowRetailPrice(int listPrice, int markup = 50)

4.Examine the following method header; then write an example call to the method.
private void ResetValue(ref int value)

		int value = 20;

		ResetValue(ref value);

5. A program contains the following value-returning method:
		private int Square(int value )
		{
			return value * value;
		}
Write a statement that passes the value 10 as an argument to this method and
assigns its return value to the variable result.

int var = Square(10);
