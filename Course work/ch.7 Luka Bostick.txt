Short Answer
1. How much memory is allocated by the compiler when you declare a value type variable?
	The amount of memory is based on the type of variable declared
	
2. What type of variable is needed to work with an object in code?
	An object variable is required, in order for an argument to be an object the reference must be passed into the method

3. What two steps are typically required for creating a reference type object?
	declaring a variable, passing it as an argument to a method by reference.

4. Are variables well suited for processing lists of data? why or why not?
	Yes, variables are precessed one by one while iterating through a list.

5. What value is returned by the Length property of an array?
	The amount of reference varables declared in the array (exclusive)

6. What can cause an off-by-one error when working with an array?
	Couting the legnth of the array excluaivly insetead of inclusively 

7. How do you keep track of elements that contain data in a partially filled array?
	You assign the index to a variable.

8. Briefly describe the selection sort algorithm.
	Exclusively iterate through the list, save the value at the index of loop control variable,
	loop through all of the indices ajacent to the curent temp value, if the value at the array
	index lcv2 is larger than of the value at at the array of index lcv1 swap the values. On^2

9. How is the binary search more efficient that the sequential search algorithm?
	Binary search splits the list in half and then perform the steps of of the selection sort.
	This method also makes it possible to preform multiple sort steps at the same time 
	in separate asyncrounes threds.
	
10. What advantages does a List have over an array?
	A list can store objects and variables of differing data types

11. What is the result if the value of the ImageSize property does not match the size of the images that are stored in the ImageList control?
	The images will appear distored when you display them.
Algorithm Workbench
1. Assume names is a variable that references an array of 20 string values. Write a foreach loop that displays each of the elements of the array in a ListBox control.

	foreach(string str in sList)
        {
            outputListBox.Items.Add(values[str.IndexOf()];
        }
		
2. The variables numberArray1 and numberArray2 reference arrays that have 100 elements each. Write code that copies the values from numberArray1 to numberArray2.

`	 // Create a two arrays
    const int ROWS = 100;
    
    int[] numberArray1 = new int[ROWS];
    int[] numberArray2 = new int[ROWS];
 
    // Fill the array with random numbers.
    for(int row = 0; row < ROWS; row++)
    {
      numberArray1[row] = numberArray2[row];
    }

3. Write code for a sequential search that determines whether the value -1 is stored in an array with a reference variable named values. The code should display a message indicating whether the value was found. 

	int value = 0;
     int[] arr = new  int[];
	 
        while (true)
        {
					//sentan
            if ( arr[value]== "-1")
            {
			 Console.WriteLine($"-1 wasfound");
                break;
            }
            value++;
        }

        Console.WriteLine($"-1 was not found");
    }
4. Write a declaration statement that creates a two-dimensional array referenced by a variable named grades. The array should store int values using 18 rows and 12 columns.
	// Create a two-dimensional int array
    const int ROWS = 18;
    const int COLS = 12;
    int[,] grades = new int[ROWS,COLS];
   
   
5. Write code that sums each column in the array in Question 4.
	int sun = 0;
	
   for(int cols = 0; cols < COLS; cols++)
   {
       sum += grades[0,cols]; 
   }

6. Create a List object that uses the binary search algorithm to search for the string "A". Display a message box indicating whether the value was found.

	
7. Write a statement that retrieves the image stored at index 0 from an ImageList control named slideShowImageList and displays it in a PictureBox control named slideShowPictureBox.
