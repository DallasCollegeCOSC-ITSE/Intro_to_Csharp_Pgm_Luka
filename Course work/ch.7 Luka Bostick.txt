Algorithm Workbench
1. Assume names is a variable that references an array of 20 string values. Write a foreach loop that displays each of the elements of the array in a ListBox control.
2. The variables numberArray1 and numberArray2 reference arrays have 100 elements each. Write code that copies the values from numberArray1 to numberArray2.
3. Write code for a sequential search that determines whether the value -1 is stored in an array with a reference variable named values. The code should display a message indicating whether the value was found. 
4. Write a declaration statement that creates a two-dimensional array referenced by a variable named grades. The array should store int values using 18 rows and 12 columns.
5. Write code that sums each column in the array in Question 4.
6. Create a List object that uses the binary search algorithm to search for the string "A". Display a message box indicating whether the value was found.
7. Write a statement that retrieves the image stored at index 0 from an ImageList control named slideShowImageList and displays it in a PictureBox control named slideShowPictureBox.
