Short Answer
1.In what situation do traditional files work well for storing data?

	Traditional files work well for storing data in small-scale applications where the
	data is not too complex, and there are not too many records to manage.
	
	
2.Briefly describe the layered nature of an application that works with a DBMS.
	The layered nature of an application that works with a DBMS refers to the way
	the application is organized into different layers or tiers, each responsible for
	a specific aspect of the application. The layers typically include the presentation
	layer (user interface), business logic layer (application logic), and data access 
	layer (communication with the DBMS).

3.What is the data that is stored in a row of a table in a database divided into?
	The data that is stored in a row of a table in a database is divided into columns,
	with each column representing a specific attribute of the data.

4.Are the data types used when creating a database table C# data types? if not, what kind of data types are they?
	No, the data types used when creating a database table are not C# data types. They are specific to the
	DBMS being used, such as MySQL, Oracle, or SQL Server.

5.How do you create a primary key for a table with colums that could potentially contain the same values?

	To create a primary key for a table with columns that could potentially contain the same
 values, you would create a new column specifically for the primary key and set it to
 auto-increment or use a sequence generator. This ensures that each row has a unique 
 primary key value.


6.What type of columns in a dasebase table must always contain a value?
	Columns in a database table that are defined as NOT NULL must always contain a value.
	If a value is not provided for a NOT NULL column when inserting a new row,
	an error will occur.

7.Instead of working with the database directly, which what component does an application work?
	An application works with a data access component, such as a dataset, that communicates 
	with the DBMS to retrieve and modify data.

8.What control can be used to display an entire database table in a scrollable grid an application work?
	
	A DataGridView control can be used to display an entire database table in a scrollable
	grid in an application.

9.What is a Details view?
	A Details view is a user interface control that displays the details of a 
	single record from a database table. It is useful when working with large 
	datasets where displaying multiple rows at once would be overwhelming.

10.In SQL, what statement do you yse to retrieve specific rows from a table in a batebase?
	
	In SQL, you use the SELECT statement to retrieve specific rows from a table in a database. 
	The SELECT statement can be customized with various clauses, such as WHERE, ORDER
	BY, and GROUP BY, to retrieve specific subsets of data.
	
	
11.How do you sort the results of a Select query in decending order in SQL?
	To sort the results of a SELECT query in descending order in SQL, you add 
	the DESC keyword after the column name in the ORDER BY clause.
	For example, "SELECT * FROM mytable ORDER BY mycolumn DESC;" would 
	sort the results in descending order based on the values in the
	"mycolumn" column.

Algorithm Workbench
1.Look at the following SQL statement:

	Select Name From Emplpyee
	
	a.
	b.
	
	For Question 2-8, assume that a Database has a table named Stock, with the following columns:
	
	Column Name					Type
	Trading_Symbol				nchar(10)
	Company_Name				nchar(25)
	Num_Shares					int
	Purchase_Price				money
	Selling_Price				money
	
2.Write a Select statement that returns all the columns from every row in the table.


3.Write a Select statement that returns only the Trading_Symbol column from every row in the table.


4.Write a Select statement that returns the Trading_Symbol column and the Num_Shares column from every row in the table.


5.Write a Select statement that returns the Trading_Symbol column only from the rows where Purchase_Price is greater than $25.00


6.Write a Select statement that returns all the columns from the rows where Trading_Symbol starts with "SU"


7.Write a Select statement that returns the Trading_Symbol column only from the rows where Selling_Price is greater than Purchase_Price and NUm_Shares is grater than 100.


8.Write a Select statement that returns the Trading_Symbol column and the Num_Shares column only from the rows where Selling_Price is greater than Purchase_Price and num_Shates is greater than 100. The resulys should be stored by the Num_Shares column in ascending order.
