Algorithm Workbench
1.Look at the following SQL statement:

	Select Name From Emplpyee
	
	a.
	b.
	
	For Question 2-8, assume that a batabase has a table named Stock, with the following columns:
	
	Column Name					Type
	Trading_Symbol				nchar(10)
	Company_Name				nchar(25)
	Num_Shares					int
	Purchase_Price				money
	Selling_Price				money
	
2.Write a Select statement that returns all the columns from every row in the table.
3.Write a Select statement that returns only the Trading_Symbol column from every row in the table.
4.Write a Select statement that returns the Trading_Symbol column and the Num_Shares column from every row in the table.
5.Write a Select statement that returns the Trading_Symbol column only from the rows where Purchase_Price is greater than $25.00
6.Write a Select statement that returns all the columns from the rows where Trading_Symbol starts with "SU"
7.Write a Select statement that returns the Trading_Symbol column only from the rows where Selling_Price is greater than Purchase_Price and NUm_Shares is grater than 100.
8.Write a Select statement that returns the Trading_Symbol column and the Num_Shares column only from the rows where Selling_Price is greater than Purchase_Price and num_Shates is greater than 100. The resulys should be stored by the Num_Shares column in ascending order.
