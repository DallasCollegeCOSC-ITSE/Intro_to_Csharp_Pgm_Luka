 *	Think abt some of the different ways that people use Computers. In school,
 *	students use computers for tasks such as writting papers, searching for 
 *	articales, sending e-mail, and participating in online classes. At work,
 *	people use computers to analyse data, make presentations, conduct business
 *	transaction, communicate with customers and coworkers, control machines 
 *	in manufacturing facilities, and do many other things. At home, people use
 *	computers for tasks such as paybills, shopping online, staying connected
 *	with firends and family, and playing computer games.
 *	And don't forget that smart phones, tablets, car navigation system, and ,many
 *	other devices are computers as well. The uses of computers are almost limitless
 *	in out everyday lives. Computers can do such a wide variety of things because
 *	they can be programmed, which means that computers are designed not to do just 
 *	one job, but to do any job that their programs tell them to do. 
 *	
 *	A program is a set of instercutions that a computer follows to perform a task.

 * Programs are commonly referred to as software. Software is essential to
 * a computer because without software, a computer can do nothing. All the 
 * software that makes our computers useful created by individuals know as
 * programmers, or software developers. A programmer, or software developer,
 * is a person with the training and skills necessary to design, create and
 * test computer programs. Computer programming is an exciting and rewarding
 * career. ( cap) Todays, programmer work in business, medicine, government,
 * law enforcement, agriculture, academics, entertainment, and almosy every
 * other field.
 * 
 * this book introduces you to the fundamental concepts of computer
 * programming using the c# programming language. Before we begin exploring 
 * those concepts, you need to understand a few basic things abt computers
 * and how they work.
 * This chapter provides a solid foundation of knowledge that
 * you will continually rely pm as ypu study computers science. 
 * 
 * First, we discuss the physical components that computers are commonly made of.
 * 
 * Then, we look at how computers store data execute programs.
 * Next, we intorduce you to two fundamental elements of modern software design
 * : graphical user interdaces and objs. Finally we give a quick intorduction to the 
 * software used to write C# programs.

 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *								Concept
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * The physical devices that a computer is made of are referred to as
 * the computer's hardware. The programs that run on a computer are to as
 * software.

 *							Hardware
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *			Hardware refers to the physical devices, or components,
 *		of which a computer is made. A computer is not one single
 *		device but is a system of devices that all work together. 
 *		Like the different instruments in a symphony orchestra, each device
 *		in a computer plays its own part.
 *		
 *		If you have ever shopped for a computer, you jave probably seen sales
 *		literature listing components such as microprocessors, memory, disk 
 *		drives, video displays, graphics card, and so fourth. 
 *		
 *		Unless you already know a lot abt computers or at least have a firend
 *		who does,understanding what these different components do can be
 *		confusing.
 *		
 *		systems consists of the folloiwing major components:
 *		
 *		*The central processing unit (CPU)
 *		
 *		*Main memory
 *		
 *		*Secondary storagr devices
 *		
 *		* Input devices
 *		
 *	LEts take a closer look at each of these components

 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                              The CPU             
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * When a computer is performing the task that a program tells it to do, we
 * 
 * say that computer is running or executing the program. The Centeral proc
 * essing unit, or CPU, is the part of a computer that runs the prgrams.
 * 
 * The CPU is the most important component in a computer because without
 * it the computer could not run software.
 * 
 * IN the earliest computers, CPUs were huge devices made of electrical
 * and mechanical components such as vauum tubes and switches.
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                  Figure 1-3 shows such a device.  
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * The two women in the photo are working with the historic ENIAC computer. 
 * 
 * The ENIAC, considered by many to be the world's first programmable
 * electronic computer, was built in 1945 to calculate artillery ballistic
 * tables for the U.S.Army. This machine, which wasx primarily one big CPU,
 * was 8 feet tall and 100 feet long and weighed 30 tons.
 * 
 * Today, CPUs are small chips known as microprocessors.
 * Figure 1-4 shows a photo of a lab technician holding a modern-day
 * microprocessor. Inadditioon to being much smaller than the old
 * electromechanical CPUs in early computers.
 * microprocessors are also much more powerful.
 *

 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                      Main Memory
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * You can think of main memory ad the computer's work area.
 * This is where the computer stores a program while the program
 * is running, as well as the data that the program is working with.
 * For ex, suppose you are using word processing program to write an essay
 * for one of your classes. While you do this, both the wrod processing
 * program and the essay are stored in main memory.
 * 
 * 
 * Main memory is commonly know as random access memory, or RAM.
 * It is called this because the CPU is able to quickly access data stored at
 * any random location in RAM.
 * RAM is usually a volatile type of memory that is used only for temporary
 * storage while a program is running.
 * When the computer is turned off, the contents of RAM are eraded.
 * Inside your computer, RAM is stored in chips,
 * similary to ones shown in Figure 1-5.
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                              Secondary Storage Devices
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * 
 * Secondary storafe is a type of memory that can hold data for long periods
 * of time, even when there is no power to the computer.
 * Profgrams are normally stored in sdecondary memory and loaded into main
 * memory as needed. Important data, such as word processing documents, payroll
 * data, and inventory records, is saved to decondary storage as well.
 * 
 * The most common type of secondary storage device is the disk drive.
 * A traditional disk drive stores data by magneticallty encoding it onto
 * a spinning ciricual disk. Solid-state drives, which store data in
 * solid-state memory, are increasingly becoming popualar.
 * A solid-state memory, are increasingly becoming populaer.
 * A solid-state srive has no moving psarts and operstes faster than a 
 * traditional disk drive
 * 
 * Most computers have some sort of secondary storage device, either a 
 * traditional disk drive or a solid-state drive, mounted inside their case
 * External storage devices are also available, shice connect to one of
 * the computer's communucation ports,or plug into a memory slot.
 * Exteranl storage devices can be uised to crate backups copies or
 * important data or to move data to another computer.
 * 
 * For example, USB (Universal Serial Bus) drives anmd SD (Secure Digutal)
 * memory cards are small devices that appear in the system as disk drives.
 * They are inexpensive, reliable,
 * and small enough to be carried in your pocket.
 * 
 * Optical devices such as the compact disk(CD) and the digital versatile
 * disk (DVD) are also popular for data storage.
 * Data is not recorded magtically on a optical disk but is encoded
 * as a series of pits and thus read the encoded data, Optical dics
 * hold large amounts of data, and bacaues recordable CD and DVD
 * drives are now commonplace, they are good mediums
 * for crating backopcopies of data.

 *                          Input Devices
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * Input is any data the computer collects form people and from other devices. 
 * 
 * The conponent that collects the data and sends
 * it to the computer is called and input device.
 * 
 * Common input devices are the keyboard,
 * mouse, touchscreen, scanner, mictophone, and digital camera. 
 * 
 * Disk drives and optical drives can also be considered input
 * devices because programs and data are retriceed from them and
 * loaded into the computer's memory.
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                              Output Devices
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 *Output is any data the computer prodices for people or for other devices
 *it meight be a sales report, a list of names, or a graphic image.
 *
 *the data is sent to an output devices, which formates and presentrs it.
 *
 *Common output devices are screens and printers.
 *Storage decices can also be condidered oputput devices bnecause the system
 *sends data the them in order to be saved.
 *
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                                 Software
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *
 *  IF a computer is to function, softwere is not optional.
 *  Everything that a computer does, from the time you turn
 *  the power switch on until you shut the system down, is under the contro
 *  l of software.
 *  There are two general catogries of software:
 *  system software and application software.
 *  Most computers programs clearly fit into ine if these two catergories.
 *  Let's take a closer look at each.
 *  
 *  
 *  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                                 System Software
 *  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
 *  The programs that control and manage the basic operations of a computer are 
 *  generally reffered to as system software. System software typically includes
 *  
 *  the folloeing types of program:
 *  
 *  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                              Opersating Systems
 *  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *  
 *  An operating system is the most fundamental set od programs on a computer.
 *  
 *  The operating systems controls the internal operations of the computer's
 *  
 *  hardware, manages all the deives connected to the computer, allows other 
 *  programs to run on the computer.
 *  
 *  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                              Utility Prgrams
 *  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *  A untility programs perfoems a specialized task that enhances the computer's
 *  
 *  operation or safegauards data. 
 *  Examples of utility programs are virus scanners, files-compression
 *  programs, data-back programs.
 * 
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                          Software Development Tools
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * The software tools that programmers use to create, modify, and test
 * software are refered to as software development tools.
 * 
 * Assemblers, compilers, and interperters, which are discussed later in this ch.
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                         Application Softeare     
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * 
 * Programs that make a computer useful for everyday tasks are know as
 * application software.These are the programs tha
 * t people normally spend most if their time running on their compuers.
 * 
 * Fig 1-1 shows screen from two commonly used application-Microrsoft Word,
 * a word processing program, and Mictrosoft Powerpoint, a presentation prgram. 
 * 
 * Some other examples of appllication software are spreadsheets programs, e-mail
 * programs, web browsers, and game programs.

 *                          1.3 How Computers Store Data
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *              Concept:
 *       All data stored in a computer is converted to sequences of 0a and 1s.
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * A computer's memory is divided into tinny storage location known as bytes. 
 * One byte is enought memory to store only a letter the alphabet ot a small number. 
 * 
 * In order to do anything meaningful, a computer has to have lots of bytes.
 * Most computers today have millions, or even billions, of bytes of memory.
 * 
 * Each byte is divided into eight smaller storage location known as bits.
 * 
 * The term bit stans for binday digit. Computer scientists usually think of bits
 * as tiny switches that can either on or off. Bits arent't actual "switches,"
 * however, at least not in the conventiuonal senes. Inmost computer systems,unj
 * bits are tiny elecetircal compionts that can hold wityher
 * a positiove or neagice charge. Computers scientists think of a positicve
 * charge as a switch in the on position and a neguitve charfge as a asichv 
 * in the pff position> Figure 1-6 shows the way that a compuyer scientist
 * might think of a  byte of memory: as collection of switiches what are
 * flipped to either the on ir the off position.
 * 
 * When a piece of data is stored in a byte, the computer sets the eights
 * nits to an on/off pattern that represents the data. For ex, the pattern
 * whon on the left in Figure 1-7 showsshows the number 77 woulf be sotred
 * in a byte. in a moment, you will see hopw these patters are determined.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                              Storing Numbers
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * A bit can be used in a very limted way to represent numbers.
 * 
 * Depending on whether the bit is turned on or off, it can represnet
 * one of two different the number 0 and bit that is turned on represents the num 1.
 * 
 * This corrensponds perfectly to the binwary numbering system. In the binary
 * numbering system ( or binary, as it is usually called), all
 * numerica values are written as sequences of 0s and 1s. 
 * Here is an example of a number that us written in binary
 * 
 * The position of wach digit in a binary number has a value assigned to it. 
 * 
 * Starting with the rightmost digit andf moving left, the posotion vcalue are
 * 2^0,2^1,2^2,2^3, and so forth, as shown in Figure 1-8. Figure 1-9 shows
 * the same diagram with the position values calculated.
 * 
 * Starting with the rightmost digit and moving left,
 * the position values are 1,2,4,8, and so forth.
