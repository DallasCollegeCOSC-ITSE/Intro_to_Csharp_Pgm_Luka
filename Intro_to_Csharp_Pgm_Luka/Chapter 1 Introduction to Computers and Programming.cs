 *	Think abt some of the different ways that people use Computers. In school,
 *	students use computers for tasks such as writting papers, searching for 
 *	articales, sending e-mail, and participating in online classes. At work,
 *	people use computers to analyse data, make presentations, conduct business
 *	transaction, communicate with customers and coworkers, control machines 
 *	in manufacturing facilities, and do many other things. At home, people use
 *	computers for tasks such as paybills, shopping online, staying connected
 *	with firends and family, and playing computer games.
 *	And don't forget that smart phones, tablets, car navigation system, and ,many
 *	other devices are computers as well. The uses of computers are almost limitless
 *	in out everyday lives. Computers can do such a wide variety of things because
 *	they can be programmed, which means that computers are designed not to do just 
 *	one job, but to do any job that their programs tell them to do. 
 *	
 *	A program is a set of instercutions that a computer follows to perform a task.

 * Programs are commonly referred to as software. Software is essential to
 * a computer because without software, a computer can do nothing. All the 
 * software that makes our computers useful created by individuals know as
 * programmers, or software developers. A programmer, or software developer,
 * is a person with the training and skills necessary to design, create and
 * test computer programs. Computer programming is an exciting and rewarding
 * career. ( cap) Todays, programmer work in business, medicine, government,
 * law enforcement, agriculture, academics, entertainment, and almosy every
 * other field.
 * 
 * this book introduces you to the fundamental concepts of computer
 * programming using the c# programming language. Before we begin exploring 
 * those concepts, you need to understand a few basic things abt computers
 * and how they work.
 * This chapter provides a solid foundation of knowledge that
 * you will continually rely pm as ypu study computers science. 
 * 
 * First, we discuss the physical components that computers are commonly made of.
 * 
 * Then, we look at how computers store data execute programs.
 * Next, we intorduce you to two fundamental elements of modern software design
 * : graphical user interdaces and objs. Finally we give a quick intorduction to the 
 * software used to write C# programs.

 *						1.2 Hardware and Software
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *								Concept
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * The physical devices that a computer is made of are referred to as
 * the computer's hardware. The programs that run on a computer are to as
 * software.
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *							Hardware
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *			Hardware refers to the physical devices, or components,
 *		of which a computer is made. A computer is not one single
 *		device but is a system of devices that all work together. 
 *		Like the different instruments in a symphony orchestra, each device
 *		in a computer plays its own part.
 *		
 *		If you have ever shopped for a computer, you jave probably seen sales
 *		literature listing components such as microprocessors, memory, disk 
 *		drives, video displays, graphics card, and so fourth. 
 *		
 *		Unless you already know a lot abt computers or at least have a firend
 *		who does,understanding what these different components do can be
 *		confusing.
 *		
 *		systems consists of the folloiwing major components:
 *		
 *		*The central processing unit (CPU)
 *		
 *		*Main memory
 *		
 *		*Secondary storagr devices
 *		
 *		* Input devices
 *		
 *	LEts take a closer look at each of these components

 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                              The CPU             
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * When a computer is performing the task that a program tells it to do, we
 * 
 * say that computer is running or executing the program. The Centeral proc
 * essing unit, or CPU, is the part of a computer that runs the prgrams.
 * 
 * The CPU is the most important component in a computer because without
 * it the computer could not run software.
 * 
 * IN the earliest computers, CPUs were huge devices made of electrical
 * and mechanical components such as vauum tubes and switches.
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                  Figure 1-3 shows such a device.  
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * The two women in the photo are working with the historic ENIAC computer. 
 * 
 * The ENIAC, considered by many to be the world's first programmable
 * electronic computer, was built in 1945 to calculate artillery ballistic
 * tables for the U.S.Army. This machine, which wasx primarily one big CPU,
 * was 8 feet tall and 100 feet long and weighed 30 tons.
 * 
 * Today, CPUs are small chips known as microprocessors.
 * Figure 1-4 shows a photo of a lab technician holding a modern-day
 * microprocessor. Inadditioon to being much smaller than the old
 * electromechanical CPUs in early computers.
 * microprocessors are also much more powerful.
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                      Main Memory
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * You can think of main memory ad the computer's work area.
 * This is where the computer stores a program while the program
 * is running, as well as the data that the program is working with.
 * For ex, suppose you are using word processing program to write an essay
 * for one of your classes. While you do this, both the wrod processing
 * program and the essay are stored in main memory.
 * 
 * 
 * Main memory is commonly know as random access memory, or RAM.
 * It is called this because the CPU is able to quickly access data stored at
 * any random location in RAM.
 * RAM is usually a volatile type of memory that is used only for temporary
 * storage while a program is running.
 * When the computer is turned off, the contents of RAM are eraded.
 * Inside your computer, RAM is stored in chips,
 * similary to ones shown in Figure 1-5.
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                              Secondary Storage Devices
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * 
 * Secondary storafe is a type of memory that can hold data for long periods
 * of time, even when there is no power to the computer.
 * Profgrams are normally stored in sdecondary memory and loaded into main
 * memory as needed. Important data, such as word processing documents, payroll
 * data, and inventory records, is saved to decondary storage as well.
 * 
 * The most common type of secondary storage device is the disk drive.
 * A traditional disk drive stores data by magneticallty encoding it onto
 * a spinning ciricual disk. Solid-state drives, which store data in
 * solid-state memory, are increasingly becoming popualar.
 * A solid-state memory, are increasingly becoming populaer.
 * A solid-state srive has no moving psarts and operstes faster than a 
 * traditional disk drive
 * 
 * Most computers have some sort of secondary storage device, either a 
 * traditional disk drive or a solid-state drive, mounted inside their case
 * External storage devices are also available, shice connect to one of
 * the computer's communucation ports,or plug into a memory slot.
 * Exteranl storage devices can be uised to crate backups copies or
 * important data or to move data to another computer.
 * 
 * For example, USB (Universal Serial Bus) drives anmd SD (Secure Digutal)
 * memory cards are small devices that appear in the system as disk drives.
 * They are inexpensive, reliable,
 * and small enough to be carried in your pocket.
 * 
 * Optical devices such as the compact disk(CD) and the digital versatile
 * disk (DVD) are also popular for data storage.
 * Data is not recorded magtically on a optical disk but is encoded
 * as a series of pits and thus read the encoded data, Optical dics
 * hold large amounts of data, and bacaues recordable CD and DVD
 * drives are now commonplace, they are good mediums
 * for crating backopcopies of data.
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                          Input Devices
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * Input is any data the computer collects form people and from other devices. 
 * 
 * The conponent that collects the data and sends
 * it to the computer is called and input device.
 * 
 * Common input devices are the keyboard,
 * mouse, touchscreen, scanner, mictophone, and digital camera. 
 * 
 * Disk drives and optical drives can also be considered input
 * devices because programs and data are retriceed from them and
 * loaded into the computer's memory.
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                              Output Devices
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 *Output is any data the computer prodices for people or for other devices
 *it meight be a sales report, a list of names, or a graphic image.
 *
 *the data is sent to an output devices, which formates and presentrs it.
 *
 *Common output devices are screens and printers.
 *Storage decices can also be condidered oputput devices bnecause the system
 *sends data the them in order to be saved.
 *
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                                 Software
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *
 *  IF a computer is to function, softwere is not optional.
 *  Everything that a computer does, from the time you turn
 *  the power switch on until you shut the system down, is under the contro
 *  l of software.
 *  There are two general catogries of software:
 *  system software and application software.
 *  Most computers programs clearly fit into ine if these two catergories.
 *  Let's take a closer look at each.
 *  
 *  
 *  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                                 System Software
 *  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
 *  The programs that control and manage the basic operations of a computer are 
 *  generally reffered to as system software. System software typically includes
 *  
 *  the folloeing types of program:
 *  
 *  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                              Opersating Systems
 *  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *  
 *  An operating system is the most fundamental set od programs on a computer.
 *  
 *  The operating systems controls the internal operations of the computer's
 *  
 *  hardware, manages all the deives connected to the computer, allows other 
 *  programs to run on the computer.
 *  
 *  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                              Utility Prgrams
 *  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *  A untility programs perfoems a specialized task that enhances the computer's
 *  
 *  operation or safegauards data. 
 *  Examples of utility programs are virus scanners, files-compression
 *  programs, data-back programs.
 * 
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                          Software Development Tools
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * The software tools that programmers use to create, modify, and test
 * software are refered to as software development tools.
 * 
 * Assemblers, compilers, and interperters, which are discussed later in this ch.
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                         Application Softeare     
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * 
 * Programs that make a computer useful for everyday tasks are know as
 * application software.These are the programs tha
 * t people normally spend most if their time running on their compuers.
 * 
 * Fig 1-1 shows screen from two commonly used application-Microrsoft Word,
 * a word processing program, and Mictrosoft Powerpoint, a presentation prgram. 
 * 
 * Some other examples of appllication software are spreadsheets programs, e-mail
 * programs, web browsers, and game programs.

 *                          1.3 How Computers Store Data
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *              Concept:
 *       All data stored in a computer is converted to sequences of 0a and 1s.
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * A computer's memory is divided into tinny storage location known as bytes. 
 * One byte is enought memory to store only a letter the alphabet ot a small number. 
 * 
 * In order to do anything meaningful, a computer has to have lots of bytes.
 * Most computers today have millions, or even billions, of bytes of memory.
 * 
 * Each byte is divided into eight smaller storage location known as bits.
 * 
 * The term bit stans for binday digit. Computer scientists usually think of bits
 * as tiny switches that can either on or off. Bits arent't actual "switches,"
 * however, at least not in the conventiuonal senes. Inmost computer systems,unj
 * bits are tiny elecetircal compionts that can hold wityher
 * a positiove or neagice charge. Computers scientists think of a positicve
 * charge as a switch in the on position and a neguitve charfge as a asichv 
 * in the pff position> Figure 1-6 shows the way that a compuyer scientist
 * might think of a  byte of memory: as collection of switiches what are
 * flipped to either the on ir the off position.
 * 
 * When a piece of data is stored in a byte, the computer sets the eights
 * nits to an on/off pattern that represents the data. For ex, the pattern
 * whon on the left in Figure 1-7 showsshows the number 77 woulf be sotred
 * in a byte. in a moment, you will see hopw these patters are determined.
 * 
 * 
 * 
* //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *                              Storing Numbers
 * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * A bit can be used in a very limted way to represent numbers.
 * 
 * Depending on whether the bit is turned on or off, it can represnet
 * one of two different the number 0 and bit that is turned on represents the num 1.
 * 
 * This corrensponds perfectly to the binwary numbering system. In the binary
 * numbering system ( or binary, as it is usually called), all
 * numerica values are written as sequences of 0s and 1s. 
 * Here is an example of a number that us written in binary
 * 
 * The position of wach digit in a binary number has a value assigned to it. 
 * 
 * Starting with the rightmost digit andf moving left, the posotion vcalue are
 * 2^0,2^1,2^2,2^3, and so forth, as shown in Figure 1-8. Figure 1-9 shows
 * the same diagram with the position values calculated.
 * 
 * Starting with the rightmost digit and moving left,
 * the position values are 1,2,4,8, and so forth.
 * ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
                    1.7 The Program Development Process
   ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
    
   ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
       Concept: Creating a program requires several steps,
    which includes designing the program's logic, creating the user interface,
    writing code, testing, and debugging
   ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
    
   ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
    The program developmente Cycle
   ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
   Previously in this chapter, you learned that programmers typically use
   high-level languages such as C# to preacte programs. There 
   is much more to creating a program than writting code, however.
   The process of creating a program that workds correctly typically requires 
   the six phases shown in Figure 1-25. 
   The entire process is know as the program development cycle
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
        1. Understand The program's purpose
    When beginning a new programming project, it is essential that you
    understand what the program is suppoed to do. Most programs perform the 
    following three-step process
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
    Step 1. Input is reecived
    Step 2 Some process is performed on the input
    Step 3 Output is produced
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
    Input is any data that the program recives while it is running.
     Once input is recieved, some process, such as a mathematical
     Calculation, is usually performed on it. The results of the
     process are then sent out fo the program as output.
     If you can identify these elements of a program(input,
     process, and output), then you are on your way to understaning
     what the program is suppoed to do.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
    Ex, suppose you have been asked to write a program to calculate
    and display the gross pay for an hourly paid employee.
    Here is a summary of the programs's input, procvess, and output:
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
    INPUT:
            *INput the numberof hours that the employee worked.
            *Input the employee's hourly pay rate.
            *
    PROCESS:
            *Multiply the number of houts worked by the hourlt pay rate.
            *The reult is the employee's gross pay
    Output:
            * Display the employee's gross pay on the screen.
            * 
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
                2. DESIGN THE GUI
    Once you clearly understand what the program is suppoed to do, you can
    begin designing its GUI. Gften, you will find it helpful to draw a sketch
    of each form that the program displays. 
    Ex, if you are designing a program that calculates gross pay,
    Figure 1-26 shows how you night sketch the program's form.
    Notice that the sketch identifies each type of control (GUI object) that 
    will appear on the form. The TextBox controls will allow the user to enter input
    The user will type the number of hours worked into one of the TextBoxes
    and the employee's hourly pay rate into the other TextBox.
    Notice that Label contols are placed on the form to tell the user what data to enter.
    When the user clicks the Button control that reads Calculate Gross Pay, 
    the program will display the employee's gorss pay on the screen in a pop-up window.
    When the user clicks the Button control that reads Calculaute gross pay,
the program will display the employee's gross pay on the screen in a pop-up window.
When the user clicks the Button control that reads Exit, the program will end.
Once you are satisfied with tehe sketches that you have created for the program's forms,
you can begin creating the actual forms on the computer.
As a Visual C# programmer,
you have a powerful envionment know as Visual Studio <3 at youtr disposal. 
Visual Studio gives you a "what you see is what you get" editor that allows
you to visual design a program's forms.
You can use Visual Studio to create
the program's forms, place all the necessary contols on the forms,
and set each control's properties so it has the desired appearance.
For ex, Figure 1-27 shows the actual form that you might create
for the wage-calculator program, which calculates gross pay.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
    3. DESIGN THE PROGRAM'S LOGIC
In this phase you break down each task that the propgram must perform
into a series of logical steps. For exa,ple, if you look back at
Figure 1-27, notice that the pay-calculating program's form has
a Button control that reads CALCULATE GROSS PAY.
Here are the steps that the program should take to perform that task:
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
    Step 1* Get th number of hours worked from the appropriate TextBox.
    Step 2* Get the hourly pay rate from the appropriate TextBox.
    Step 3* Calculate the gorss pay as the number of hours worked times the hourly pay rate.
    Step 4* Display the gross pay in a pop-up window.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
This is an example of an algo, which is a set of well-defined, logical steps that must
be taken to perform a task.
An algo that is written out in this manner,in plain
English statements, is called pesudocode. 
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
(the word pseudo means fake, so pesudocode is fake code.)
The process of informally writing out the steps of an algo in pseudocode
before attempting to write any actual code is very
helpful when you care desiging a programs. 
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
Because you do not have to worry about breaking any syntaxrules, you can
focus on the logical steps that the prgram must focus on.
Flowcharting is another tool that programmers use to design programs.
A flowchart is a diagram that graphically depicts the steps of an algo.
Figure 1-28 shows how you might create a flowchart for the wage-calculator algorithm, as described here:
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
    * The ovals, which appear at the top and botton of the flowchart,
    * are called terminal symbols. 
    * The Start terminal symbol marks the program's 
    * and the End terminal symbol marks the program's ending point.
   
    * Parallelograms are used as input symbols and output symbols.
    * They represent steps in which the program reads input or displayes output.
    
    *Rectangles are used as processing symbols.
    *They represent steps in which the program performs some process
    *on data, such as a mathematical calculation
    
    The symbols are connected by arrows that represent the "flow" of the program.
To step through the symbols in the proper order,
you begin at the start terminal and follow
the arrows until you reach the End terminal. 
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
    4. WRITE THE CODE
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
    Once you have created a program's GUI and design algorithms for the
program's task, you are ready to start writing code. During this process,
you will refer to the pseudocode or flowchart that you created in Step 3
and use Visual Studio to write C# code.
    
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
    5. CORRECT SYNTAX ERRORS
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
///
You previously learned in this chapter that a programming
language such as C# has rules known as syntax, that must be followed
when writting a program.A language's syntax rules dictate things such
as how keywords, operators,and punctuation characters can be used.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
///
A syntax error occurs if the programmer violates any of these rules.
If the program contains a syntax error or even a simple mistake such as
a misspelled keyword, the program cannot be compiled or executed.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
///
Virtually all code contains syntax errors when it is first written, so the 
programmer will typically spend some time correcting these. Once all the 
syntax errors and simple typing mistakes have been corrected, the program
can be compiled and translated into an executable program.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
6. TEST THE PROGRAM AND CORRECT LOGIC ERRORS
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
Once the code is in an executable form, you must then test it to determine
whether any logic errors exist. A logic error is a mistake that does not
prevent the program from running but causes it to produce incorrect results.
(Matherematical mistakes are common causes of logic errors.)
If the program produces incorrect results, the programmer must debig the code.
This means that the programmer finds and corrects logic errors in the program.
Sometimes, during this process, the programmer discovers that the program's original 
design must be changed.
In this even, the program development cycle starts over and continues until no errors can be found.

/// 
/// //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// Setp 2:
/// Click FIle oon the menu bar at the top of the screen then select new, and then select project.
/// 
/// After doing this , the new Project window shown in Figure 1-33 should be displayed.
/// 
/// //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// Setp 3: At the ledt side of the window, under Installed Templetes,
/// make sure Visual C# is selected.
/// Then, Select windos Froms App (.NET Framework), as shown in Figure 1-33.
/// 
/// //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// Setp 4: At the bottom of the new Project window, you see a Name text box.

///             By default, the solution name is the same as the project name.
///             
///             For all the projects that you create in this book, you should

/// As you work through this book, you will create a lot of vsC# projects.
/// 
/// AS you do, you will find that default names such as WindowsFormsApp1 do not
/// help you remember what each project does: therefore, you should always

/// project's purpose.
/// //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// Setp 5:Click the Ok button to create the project. It might take a moment
